    <!-- There are two types of the size unit of measures :
        1. relative : adaptive which support responsiveness. ex. size in %, vw, vh, rem, etc.
        2. absolute : fixed size. (not responsive) ex. size in px.
    Sizes to make webpage responsive:
        If we want to make web-page responsive we have to use the vw(viewport width) , vh(viewport height), rem(root em).
    Viewport : window of the browser. 
        1. 1vw => 1% of the viewport width.
        2. 1vh => 1% of the viewport height.
        3. rem => font size of the browser.
            1 rem => font-size-of-broswer.
            suppose, font size of broswer is 16px then 1rem = 16px. 
    
        Media-query :
            Basically the media query is used to apply the different property based on the screen size to make the layout proper on any screen.
